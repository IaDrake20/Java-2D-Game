# Java-2D-Game
This is a game I mainly wrote back in highschool during sophomore year. I have decided to revisit it and finish what I started. Feel free to download the .java file and run it for yourself. I am still trying to sort everything out in spare time, so the code is still a mess thanks to past self.

Objectives: 
  1) Patch holes in the map where the ping pong ball can escape
  2) make a version that doesn't have debugging text
  3) change ball to "bounce" based off of angle and not in a random direction...IE add physics
  4) add local area network support to the game (maybe switch priority with 4)
  5) Add xbox controller support? (maybe switch priority with 3)
